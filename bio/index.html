    <h1>Background</h1>
    
    <p>
    This document provides a brief account of the author’s background and a personal interpretation of that background.
    The first section is factual and descriptive.
    The second section is explicitly subjective.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Objective Background</h2>
    
    <p>
    The author was raised and educated within modern Western institutional systems.
    Their academic training is primarily technical and analytical in nature, with emphasis on mathematics, engineering, and computational reasoning.
    Professional experience has involved structured problem-solving, systems analysis, and work within hierarchical organizations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Material conditions have been stable by global standards.
    Basic needs have been met.
    There has been access to education, information, and technological resources.
    No claims of exceptional hardship or exceptional privilege are made beyond these facts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Socially, the author has tended toward observation rather than participation.
    Interests have been predominantly introspective and analytical.
    This disposition has influenced both professional orientation and personal development.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Expand if necessary, but keep factual and restrained -->

    <h2>2. Subjective Interpretation</h2>
    
    <p>
    From the author’s perspective, the combination of analytical temperament and prolonged exposure to social systems has produced a persistent sense of distance.
    Rather than experiencing these systems as intuitive or meaningful, they are perceived primarily as structured incentive environments.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This perception has shaped emotional responses.
    Curiosity has coexisted with frustration.
    Engagement has often felt conditional, mediated by status, conformity, or performance rather than mutual understanding.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The tension between cognitive clarity and emotional dissatisfaction has been a recurring theme.
    While understanding the mechanics of systems can reduce confusion, it does not necessarily produce fulfillment.
    Awareness, in this sense, has functioned as both a tool and a burden.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This writing does not seek resolution.
    It records a standpoint.
    The intent is accuracy rather than reassurance.
    </p>

    <h2>Closing Note</h2>
    
    <p>
    This document is provided as context, not justification.
    It is included to clarify the position from which other analyses are written, not to solicit agreement or sympathy.
